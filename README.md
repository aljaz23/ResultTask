# ResultTask
Rest API with SPRING BOOT

I had problems with making DOCKER image or building app with maven. I got some strange ERROS. Only way to run app is to clone repository.


HOW TO RUN APP:

You need to clone this repository. In cmd go to the result-spring-boot folder and type (for windows) mvnw spring-boot:run.

For exmaple type: http://localhost:8080/v1/Call?apiCall=3 and see results.
